# Java Space

This folder contains students home tasks for the Java course.

If you'd like to submit your homework here, please create a new folder with your name and a single project inside
this folder that will be used for all home tasks.

Solution of every task should be defined as a separate class with a package
`com.zoolatech.lecture${lecture_number}.tasks._${task_number}`, where task_number is the number of a task in the list.

Solution might also contain multiple classes: they should be defined in the same package, but it's up to you if they
are split into subpackages.

Please also include a task description as the class level comment.

Example:

```java
package com.zoolatech.lecture1.tasks._1;

/**
 * Write a program that accepts numbers of miles as a floating point number,
 * converts it to kilometers and outputs the result.
 */

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // task solution code here
    }
}
```
